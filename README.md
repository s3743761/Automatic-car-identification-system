Introduction : We have built an Automatic Car share system which allows the the user to book, find and unloack and lock a car. In addition, the a customer can report some issues with the car to help the company maintain the cars. There are four types of users : customer,company,manager adn engineers and system administrator. The system administrator can do the following-:
- View car rental history
- search and view cars and user
- add,remove and update details
- Repoort cars with issue
-logout.
The company manager can login to the website and capture key information by looking at visualisation dashboard. Upon logging in, a dashboard webpage will be shown. In the dashboard webpage, 3 types of visualisation graph are shown. They are able to indicate business status to help manager making business decision

engineers take responsibility to repair the reported cars. They will receive a notification via email once admin reported a car that is needed to be repaired. After that, the engineer can login to the system to check out and find the carâ€™s location.
