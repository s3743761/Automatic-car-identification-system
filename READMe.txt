Introduction : 
We have built an Automatic Car share system which allows the the user to book, find and unloack and lock a car. In addition, the a customer can report some issues with the car to help the company maintain the cars. There are four types of users : customer, company, manager and engineers and system administrator. The system administrator can do the following-:
View car rental history
search and view cars and user
add,remove and update details
Repoort cars with issue -logout. The company manager can login to the website and capture key information by looking at visualisation dashboard. Upon logging in, a dashboard webpage will be shown. In the dashboard webpage, 3 types of visualisation graph are shown. They are able to indicate business status to help manager making business decision
engineers take responsibility to repair the reported cars. They will receive a notification via email once admin reported a car that is needed to be repaired. After that, the engineer can login to the system to check out and find the car’s location.
For the search function user could chose typing the key word or voice search. 
Listening function could catch user voice. And do the search with the information that people speak.

For user using AP
system could get the user information by scan QR code.
